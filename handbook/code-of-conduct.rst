Code of Conduct
===============

A formal code of conduct, a policy setting out expected standards of behaviour, is de rigeuer for
Python and Django events, and a formal requirement for events that are funded by the Python or
Django Software Foundations.

A code of conduct serves a number of purposes:

* it provides reassurance to atttendees that they will not be subjected to unpleasant treatment by
  other people
* it reminds people that the way they interact with other people matters
* it helps remove ambiguity about acceptable standards of behaviour
* it makes it easier to deal with any problems that do arise

You don't have to have a code of conduct, but there will be plenty of people who won't attend or
won't speak if you don't.

Occasionally, people raise questions about the need for a code of conduct, on various grounds (that
people should be trusted to behave decently; that it's unnecessary to remind attendees not to
harrass others; that it's part of some sort of feminist conspiracy to prevent men from having fun,
and more).

These questions are only ever raised by people who have never been harrassed, insulted, abused or
otherwise had their enjoyment of a conference spoiled by someone else.

See the :doc:`example </documents/code-of-conduct>` for a suggestion on your code of conduct text.
