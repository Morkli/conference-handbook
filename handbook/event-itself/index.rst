================
The event itself
================


Various things will determine the fundamental shape and character of your event, including its
scale, duration and ethos.

You need to have a very strong idea of all of these from the start - they are what your conference
will be, and they need to be commnicated clearly otherwise potential attendees and sponsors won't
understand what it is that they're being asked to commit to.


Focus
=====

What is your event actually about? Why are you holding it and what do you want attendees to get out
of it?

An established event will largely have these questions settled, by remit and tradition. If you're
organising a DjangoCon, you'll know what's expected for example. If you're holding a new event,
you'll need to make some decisions.

:doc:`/essentials/venues` and location are part of this too, but are discussed elsewhere.

The ethos of the conference will be determined by the :doc:`/policies/index` you adopt.
