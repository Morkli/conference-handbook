Preamble
========

DjangoCon Europe is a community conference. We value the participation of each member of the Django
community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable experience. All attendees - delegates,
speakers, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors and organisers - are expected to abide by this Code of
Conduct. If necessary, the organisers will act to enforce it.

Code of conduct text
====================

All attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout the conference and at
all conference events. This includes social and fringe events, whether officially sponsored by
DjangoCon Europe or not.

All communication should be appropriate for a general audience, which may include children and
people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not welcome.

DjangoCon Europe will not tolerate harassment in any form, or language, imagery or behaviour that
are:

* sexist, racist or exclusionary
* intimidating or threatening
* insulting or unpleasant

Harassment can include: offensive verbal comments related to sex or gender, sexual orientation,
disability, appearance, body size, race, religion; the use of sexual images; deliberate
intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of
talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Should there be a problem
=========================

If you are troubled by the behaviour of another attendee at the conference, or are concerned that
another attendee may be in distress, please speak immediately to any member of conference staff or
contact our code of conduct liaison volunteers.

[Include the name and photo of each of the volunteers here.]

Your concern will be heard in confidence, taken seriously, and dealt with according to a documented
procedure.

Conference staff - volunteers and organisers - will be on hand throughout the conference. Any
concern, whatever it is, will be immediately passed on to a member of the conference committee. The
committee will investigate promptly and if necessary will take appropriate action. This may include:

* asking a violator of the Code of Conduct to leave the event immediately (no refunds will be
  forthcoming)
* passing on details of the incident to the Django Software Foundation and Python Software
  Foundation
* informing the police about the incident

We will provide you with a written statement of the outcome, whatever it is.

The purpose of the Code of Conduct
==================================

The Code of Conduct does not exist because we expect to deal with any such problems.

On the contrary, it exists to help give attendees confidence that they are attending an event where
high standards of behaviour are the norm, where everyone is aware of those standards, and that
something will be done should it fall short.

By signalling inclusivity and diversity as values we expect the conference to uphold, the Code of
Conduct helps guarantee that the event will indeed be inclusive and embrace diversity.
