Timeline
========


Two or three years (at least)
=============================

In order to run a DjangoCon, you need plenty of experience of similar events.

Go to a DjangoCon, so you know what it's really like. In fact, don't just go to a DjangoCon, go to
your local PyCon and any other events you can.

Better still, volunteer as a helper, or get involved - as a committee member, with talks selection,
finding sponsors. Do any job that you think you can, so you get a bit of experience of it, and
explain that you're anxious to help because you want the experience.

It helps to know what it's like to be a speaker, so aim for that too.

Not only does all of this give you the experience of as many aspects as possible of community
software events, it also gives other people an experience of you - which is vital when you're
asking an entire community to trust you with one of the most important weeks in their calendar.

At all points, make a note - not just a mental note, write it down - in a DjangoCon notes file - of
how it was done, how it worked, what you would do to improve it. Seriously, **don't try to rely on
your memory**.


Fifteen months
==============

Three months from now you're going to have to present your proposal, so you need some information
to hand.

Identify your location, your :doc:`venue(s) </venues>`, your ideal dates, your :doc:`general
schedule </schedule>` and at least some :doc:`fellow organisers </committee>`.

Location
--------

You need to be aware of and make judgements about:

* how will people travel to the location
* are there easy and reasonably inexpensive connections from most places
* is there adequate accommodation available locally, and can you reserve it for your attendees
* will some attendees be excluded, either because they won't be permitted or because they might not
  be safe from harrassement - for example:

  * Israelis from many Arab countries, and vice-versa
  * gay people in certain countries

Dates
-----

Are your proposed dates affected by public holidays, scheduled elections, sporting events,
concerts, G8 summits? It can be harder than you think to find a suitable window, especially for a
larger event in a smaller city.

Venues
------

Make some initial enquiries at local venues, about:

* capacity
* suitability
* availability
* price
* accessibility
* Internet provision

Fellow organisers
-----------------

Whoever you have on paper at this stage won't necessarily be the ones involved in the end. People
you haven't met will want to join in (and will turn out to be excellent contributors), and some who
expected to be able to contribute will have have to withdraw. But you still need to have a few
people who plan to be involved. No-one's going to be very keen on a proposal that mentions only one
organiser.

If the other organisers have some experience already, so much the better.

Presentation
------------

Prepare a short presentation document, mentioning all of the above, to show that even if you don't
have all the answers you need you are at least aware of all the issues and are thinking about them.

Budget
------

Make some back-of-the-envelope calculations:

* no. of attendees
* average ticket price
* total ticket income
* expected sponsorship income
* venue and facilities hire
* catering per person
* total catering cost
* other costs

Does it look workable?


Twelve months
=============

Immediately before presenting the proposal, ask your venues to pencil you in for your preferred
dates.

Turn your back-of-the-envelope calculations into something more carefully worked out. Err always on
the side of caution.

Make your proposal.

Success?
--------

If it's successful, be prepared for twelve months of extremely hard work.

As soon as your proposal is accepted, contact the venues and hotels you previously spoke to and
start firming up your plans. Scrutinise the calendars very carefully.

Agree on dates and prices with the venues.

Agree on special conference pricing with some hotels. Get agreements about the number of rooms that
will be reserved for your attendees.

Start collecting names and contact details of potential sponsors.


Eleven months
=============

Form :doc:`your committee </committee>`. Have your first meeting. Set up your internal
communications channels (email list, IRC channel, to-do list, etc.)

Depending on local legislation, you may need to form a registered (for example for tax purposes)
organisation, register for VAT/IVA/sales tax, etc.

Buy insurance.

Start working on the things you'll need to have made decisions on before you go public:

* numbers of attendees
* ticket pricing structure
* sponsorship pricing structure
* graphic design and artwork


Nine months
===========

Get quotes for audio-visual services and filming, editing and publishing of the sessions.

Eight months
============

Accessibility
-------------

If you're planning to offer a crèche, or speech-to-text transcription, start discussing this with
service providers.


Seven months
============

Go public. It's a good idea to use an appropriate established domain (djangocon.eu, for example)
for website and email, Twitter account, and so on.

Once you have a basic website ready (a single page is enough at this stage, with information about
the location and the dates), post messages on email lists, the Django weblog, Twitter etc. It's
worth mentioning that the conference will be governed by a :doc:`/code-of-conduct`, even
if at this stage that's all you do.

You need to start collecting sponsors. Some sponsors can be relied upon to sponsor every DjangoCon
almost without questions, but they are few. Most will need to know full details of sponsorship
terms and benefits.

You'll need a proper sponsorship prospectus. It's best to have it available both as a web page and
as PDF.

Start contacting potential sponsors.

Make sure your venues have firm bookings for you. Start discussing catering arrangements with the
venues.

Make sure that your arrangements with hotels are firmly in place.

Ask the DSF to establish a fund for financial assistance. Work out how many free tickets you can
afford to offer.

Programme
---------

Think about:

* keynote talk slots (how many, potential speakers, how long)
* timetables
* length of available talk slots
* tracks
* workshops
* sprints

Your :doc:`programme of talks </talks/programme-of-talks>` is a going to be at the heart of all
this. Most other things are flexible and to some extent movable; the talks programme is much less
so.


Six months
==========

Publish a timeline of milestones on the website.

Open the call for proposals. If you haven't already chosen or invited keynote speakers, consider
submitted proposals for this too.

Open ticket sales - the point of no return.

Open the applications process for financial assistance.

Start announcing, and keep looking for, sponsors.


Five months
===========

Branding, graphics and imagery
------------------------------

Start working in earnest on:

* banners
* t-shirt designs
* stickers

Services
--------

Select your providers of:

* crèche
* AV services
* filming
* additional network services

and make your agreements.


Four months
===========

Have *all* branding, graphics and imagery ready and finalised.

Catering
--------

Discuss arrangements, including menus, in detail, with your caterers.


Three months
============

Stop accepting talk proposals and grant applications; start assessing them.

Start replying to the best proposals immediately. Make it clear that a proposal can only be
accepted once the speaker has purchased a ticket (or has submitted a grant application).

Liaise with the grants committee to ensure that they know of any applicants you'd like to have as
speakers. Make sure the grants committee understands your deadlines and the importance of making
its decisions and informing people in a timeframe that works for the conference.

Visit the venues with service providers; even if you don't, keep contact with them open.

Start compiling your conference programme booklet.

If you want to have music during breaks, start preparing your compilations.


Two months
==========

Everyone should have been informed of the decisions of the proposals and grants committees; all
speakers should have tickets.

Check again with service providers.

Publish your programme in full, or as full as possible, with a full timetable of talks, breaks,
meals and so on.

Get quotes for printing expected quantities of:

* t-shirts
* programme booklets
* signage
* badges
* lanyards

Visit the venue to find out exactly where the sponsors will have their tables, and ensure that
there's going to be enough room for them all. Start compiling a plan for the layout of sponsors'
tables.

Contact all your sponsors to remind them that they need to provide you with:

* artwork for the booklet
* any gifts they want included in the attendee pack

Let them know what size tables they will be provided with, what kind of banners they should bring,
and so on.

Your programme booklet should be essentially complete, even if there are numerous sections that are
still subject to change. Send it to your printers to ensure that you both understand each other's
requirements.

Similarly, send your proposed artwork to t-shirt, sign and other printers.

Start finding volunteers for the event.


One month
=========

Your programme should be more or less finalised. You should be in a position to provide final
numbers - or very nearly final numbers - for catering etc to your providers.

Keep updating the booklet.

Contact all your speakers to ensure that they know what to expect - what equipment they need to
bring/interface with, what format the data projectors use.

Order your:

* t-shirts
* signage
* badges
* lanyards

Make sure you know when your printing deadline is. Usually one week is enough - but don't assume
anything.

Prepare a handbook for volunteers and session chairs.

Two weeks
=========

Get other people to proofread the booklet.

Check again that all service providers are ready and have all the information, deposits and so on
that they require.

Contact volunteers inviting them to attend a meeting.

One week
========

Confirm final numbers to the catering, crèche and other providers.

Meeting with volunteers.

Registration rehearsal - if possible, do this in the space and with the equipment where you'll be
doing it on the day.

One day
=======

Bag packing with volunteers.

Open early registration - attendees at DjangoCons and PyCons love helping, and will probably be
turning up to find out if they can help. Take the opportunity to register as many as you can; each
one will be someone you don't need to register tomorrow.

Try to get a good night's sleep; you'll be up early in the morning.
