=================================================================
Handbook for open-source software community conference organisers
=================================================================

The main purpose of this document is to help you avoid being remembered as "that idiot who tried to
organise a DjangoCon".

It's based on the experiences of organising four international events (Django Weekend Cardiff 2014,
DjangoCon Europe 2014, Python Namibia 2015 and DjangoCOn Europe 2015) as well as attending many
more.

It's also aimed particularly at organisers of Python/Django community events, and reflects their
traditions and values.

*Please note that this handbook is currently incomplete and numerous sections need to be written.*

How to use the handbook
=======================

Firstly, be aware that this is a handbook, not an instruction manual. Every conference is different
enough that you some of the advice here might not be applicable, or you simply might have your own
preferences and ways of doing things.

The timeline
------------

The :doc:`timeline </timeline>` is probably the best place to start, and something you'll want to
refer to throughout the organising process. Very likely you will need to adapt to your own needs.
For example if you have decided to hold an event in six months' time, you'll need to compress the
timeline substantially.
