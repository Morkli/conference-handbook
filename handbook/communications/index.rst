All communication for your event is a balancing act between *too much* and *too little*.


Email
=====

Try to avoid sending endless email messages to people. Sometimes it's inevitable, for example if
you need attendees to update their tickets with answers to new questions.

Be warned that some attendees will *inevitably* manage to get their own email addresses wrong, and
that your messages will not reach some of them. Many more will simply fail to read them.


Twitter
=======

Twitter may be an appalling form of communication and a sign that civilisation is entering its
final decline, but it does have its uses for an event, and can do an excellent job of spreading
"buzzy" news.

**Twitter is a very bad way of communicating important information** though. Not everyone uses
Twitter, and assuming that they do excludes them. It is courteous to send important information via
email.

Don't even consider using Facebook or another closed medium for circulating conference information.
