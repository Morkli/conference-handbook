==================
Programme of talks
==================

Your programme of talks should be the jewel in the crown of your event.

It might in the end not turn out to be what people remember or value the most (for different
people, that could be the sprints, or a workshop or making new friends) but the programme of talks
is what most people will come for, what most employers will pay for their delegates to attend, and
it's the formal structure at the heart of the conference.

It's the easiest part of conference to understand - try explaining a code sprint to someone who
hasn't been to one, and the only part that many people are actually able to make judgements about.

So, you need to get this right, in advance, and to be able to promise and subsequently advertise a rich and balanced programme.
