Policies
========

The character of your event will be determined by all the decisions you make for it. Some of these
are material decisions - where it's held, when, how long it lasts, how many attendees, its focus -
and some are ideological: what values will it embody, what kind of changes it aims to effect in the
community it serves.

You will have to adopt and work to your own policies. Just because something is mentioned here
doesn't mean that you are obliged to pursue it. Be aware though that the Python and Django
communities have certain expectations - don't expect to receive much support for an event that
lacks an adequate code of conduct for example.
