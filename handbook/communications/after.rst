After the event
===============


.. note::

   After the event, you won't feel like doing much. So, you're strongly advised to prepare as much
   of the post-conference communications as you can in advance, so you need only to do a minimum
   of work later.


Feedback
========

You should ask your attendees for feedback, to find out what the experience was for them. Ask
your:

* speakers
* sponsors
* general attendees

questions appropriate to them.


Update this document
====================

On the basis of attendee feedback please update this handbook. Suggestions for improvement are very
welcome, especially if you found that any advice here was unhelpful.


Provide the feedback to next year's organisers
==============================================

Make sure the feedback is shared with other people who will find it useful. If there'll be an
edition of the conference next year, its organisers need to receive it.
