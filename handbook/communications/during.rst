During the event
================


Your programme booklet should contain most of the information that people will need to refer to
during the event - and they should be told that it does; you would be surprised how many people
don't even open it.


At registration
===============

It's worth also having a handout that is literally placed into attendees' hands when they
register, mentioning things that you want everyone to know, or that you think everyone is likely to
ask about, for example:

* code of conduct
* emergency contact information
* information on how to access the wireless network

You also need to let people know *how* they will be informed over the course of the event of
important news updates. If you're going to use a Twitter account for example, they need to know what
it is.


Announcements from the stage
============================


Any important announcements *need to be made multiple times*. People won't be in the room, or won't
be listening, or won't hear. These announcements should also be backed up in other forms (on the
website, via email or a Twitter feed for example).


Communications tools
====================

Communications during the event is generally more critical and time-sensitive than before it,
especially if it concerns things like changed venues, different dinner arrangements or the like.

* *if* everybody knows that this is where they should look, the website's ideal for announcements
* Twitter is excellent for messages about the event, but not good for important ones
* email - *if* you are sure you have everyone's email address - is best for important
  announcements, but keep it for important ones

Either way, it's best not to rely on a single mode of communication for important messages, and the
key thing is that people *must* know how to keep up with them.
