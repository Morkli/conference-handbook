Speech-to-text reporting
========================

Speech-to-text reporting - live transcription of speech to text - is currently not often used at
software conferences, but that is changing. The value it brings is immense.

How it works
------------

A team of two or more STTRs will sit together where they have a clear view of the speaker(s).
They'll typically wear headphones and will need a high quality audio feed (expect to be asked for
an XLR connector) of all the speech they are to transcribe, including questions from the floor.

They will be equipped with their own laptop computers and software, and also their stenographic
keyboards. They will produce video output from the laptops, so their text can be projected or
distributed to large-screen televisions situated at various points in the auditorium.

The text itself is in large type and scrolls up line-by-line.

Their text follows the speech with a minimal delay.

If you plan to use the transcripts to accompany the published conference videos, mention this
beforehand when asking for a quote, because it's not necessarily included and involves additional
work.

The STTRs need to work in a team as it involves intense concentrations, and they will usually
switch over to each other every 20 minutes or so. They will be working extremely hard all day, so
let them have an accurate picture of your day's schedule in advance so they know what to expect.

Your STTRs should also be provided with:

* a list of all speakers' names and talk titles
* a list of the most commonly technical terms you expect speakers to use
* plenty of thank-yous from the podium

Why you need it
---------------

In fact you'll find that during breaks the STTRs receive a lot of attention and kind words from
your attendees.

Usually speech-to-text reporting is provided for people with hearing impairments, but in fact just
about *everyone* benefits from it. Attendees whose first language is not English - a significant
proportion of most software conferences, and nearly all of them at an event like a DjangoCon Europe
- find it extremely useful. It doesn't just help them catch more of the words or meaning that they
might otherwise have missed, it also makes the whole experience at the conference more relaxing,
because they know that if their attention falters for a moment they can simply look up at one of
the screens and pick up the thread again.

For people who actually have hearing impairments, speech-to-text reporting can be enough to make it
worth coming to an event in the first place.

At DjangoCon Europe 2015, the STTRs and the service they provided turned out to be one of the most
memorable parts of the event. Dozens of people made a point of telling us how the speech-to-text
reporting had improved the conference for them, and the STTRs received a long standing ovation and
flowers from the audience in appreciation.

Cost
----

Speech-to-text reporting at DjangoCon Europe cost us £2850 (£2530 for services at the event, plus
£320 for the transcripts) for two STTRs over four days; the service was worth every penny.

How to hire STTRs
-----------------

Our STTRs were `Sheryll Holley <http://speechtotext.co.uk>`_ and `Hilary Maclean
<mailto:hilarymaclean20@gmail.com>`_, both very highly recommended. They were provided by `Action
on Hearing Loss <http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk>`_ (formerly known as the Royal National
Institute for the Deaf), but STTRs can also be approached directly.

See the UK `Assocation of Verbatim Speech to Text Reporters <http://www.avsttr.org.uk>`_.
