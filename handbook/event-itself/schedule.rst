Schedule
========


Most DjangoCons have been three days of talks followed by two of sprints. This pattern of talks
followed by a shorter and more informal period of sprints is also used by other events (PyCon UK,
PyCon Italia).

Some events have started with a day of paid-for workshops (PyCon Ireland, DjangoCon US).

Others have begun with an open day (i.e. free and open to any visitors) of talks and workshops
(Django Weekend, DjangoCon Europe 2015).

DjangoCon Europe 2015 also turned the two days of sprints into two days of code, with workshops and
clinics scheduled alongside the sprints.

It's up to you what sort of schedule you adopt, and what sort of emphasis you place on the various
parts of it.

.. _paid_for_workshops:

Paid-for workshops
==================

Typically these are held at the start of the conference, and can be a useful way of generating a
little extra funds for the event.

The fact that the workshops are paid-for can actually stand in their favour, especially when
employers are paying for someone to attend - it's sometimes a language that they find easier to
understand.

On the other hand, be aware that if you're selling places at a workshop, then the typical
we're-all-in-this-together attitude of a DjangoCon workshop might not be appropriate, and the
workshop leaders will need to be aware of this.

.. _open_day:

Open day
========

An open day provides a lower bar to entry, and gives people a chance to experience something of a
conference at no cost - and if they like it, they might be back next year.

As well as an introduction to the community, your open day is also an opportunity to offer
introductory technical sessions (talks and workshops) that will help draw in people from outside
the field, or beginners in the field.

If your open day is held first, its introductory sessions can serve a third purpose, by helping
less experience attendees gain some valuable technical knowledge or skills in advance of the main
body of talks that will follow.

An open day gives you a chance to provide an extra platform for speakers or space for
talks. For example, some first-time speakers will prefer to face a more general audience rather
than one of perceived experts, while some talks may simply be more suited to this audience.

Finally, an open day helps you spread your registration out over an extra day, and can take a great
deal of pressure off you and your volunteers.

.. _talks:

Talks
=====

Most people - not entirely correctly - regard the days of talks as being the part of the conference
that matters most. It's the part that is most heavily-attended, and usually the part that requires
the most planning.

It's also the part where your conference will be judged most exactingly and expectations are
highest.

Planning a good day of talks, or days of talks, is an art, and you have to choose between numerous
different approaches and structures even before you consider the content of the programme.

.. _sprints:

Sprints
=======

One of the challenges of a conference is getting a good number of attendees at the sprints.
Usually, the number who stay on for the sprints drops to around a third or a fifth of the "main"
conference attendance.

Ways of raising this number include:

* offering workshops and clinics alongside the sprints
* providing food and refreshment at no extra cost
* ensuring that other services (such as volunteer assistance, or a cr√®che) continue to be provided
  during the sprints
* holding a social event on one of the sprint evenings
* not referring to the days of the sprints simply as "sprints", since it's not meaningful to many
  people, or to the days of talks as the "main" conference - call them two days of "code", or
  "collaboration"

At DjangoCon Europe 2015, the combination of these choices raised the numbers staying on for the
two days of sprints to about two-thirds of the total, and the two days of code were treated as an
integral part of the conference.

Sometimes though the conference organisers sometimes leave it to a separate organisation to take
responsibility for managing the sprints, and the sprints are essentially a fringe activity of the
main conference.


Days of the week
================

.. note::

    The discussion below assumes that your weekend is Friday and Saturday (there are many parts of
    the world where this isn't the case).

You'll probably spend a lot of time trying to decide which days your conference should start and
end on, but it also probably doesn't matter that much when it starts, especially for a large and
established event.

Even so, an event that starts on a Saturday and ends on a Tuesday somehow seems not quite right;
dropping your attendees out of the magical bubble of a community conference into the middle of a
cold hard week will be a shock to their system. So although when it starts might not matter so
much, it should probably *end* at or just before a weekend.

It's harder for people to justify, to themselves and employers, that they should be attending a
sprint during the working week, so it's a good idea to have your sprints at the weekend if you can.

PyCon UK traditionally ends with its day of sprints on Monday, having run from the previous Friday
- and probably would be better attended on that day if it were a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.

For a smaller, newer event, making use of weekends makes sense; a Friday-Sunday conference has a
nice sense of fit with the working week.
