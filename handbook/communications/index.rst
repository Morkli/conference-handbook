Communicate as much and as often as possible. It is almost impossible to do too much communication
about your event. Keep sending messages, reminders, advertisements, encouragement, by email, via
Twitter and every medium at your disposal.


Inclusive communication
=======================

Email and your website are the primary tools for communicating with your attendees. Remember that
not everyone uses Facebook or Twitter or other social networks. If you rely exclusively on them
you will exclude some of your own attendees.
