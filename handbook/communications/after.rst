After the event
===============


.. note::

   After the event, you won't feel like doing much. So, you're strongly advised to prepare as much
   of the post-conference communications as you can in advance, so you need only to do a minimum
   of work later.


Feedback
========

You should ask your attendees for feedback, to find out what the experience was for them. Ask
your:

* speakers
* sponsors
* general attendees

questions appropriate to them.


Provide the feedback to next year's organisers
==============================================

Make sure the feedback is shared with other people who will find it useful. If there'll be an
edition of the conference next year, its organisers need to receive it.
