Committee
=========


You can't do this alone. It will be damaging for you, and extremely risky for the event.

You need to find ways to build collaboration into the working process early on. If you're not good
at that - for example if your natural inclination is to find it easier to do everything yourself -
you need to start learning how to do it.


Committee roles
===============

You should establish clear roles and responsibilities as soon as possible. Your committe should have a formal:

* Chair - the person leading the event
* Treasurer - to handle money: banking, invoicing, payments
* Secretary - to maintain an official record of meetings, and note who has agreed to do what

There are also other roles that need to be allocated; one person can take on more than one of these, and people can be jointly responsible:

* Communications - publicity, news
* Designer - print and web, posters, banners, t-shirts, badges
* Webmaster - web content and updates
* Tickets - responsible for tickets, refunds, allocations
* Sponsorship


Fostering collaboration
=======================

Your team needs to be that: a team.

It doesn't matter how energetic or experienced each person on the team is, you need to find a way
to ensure that they can all, and will all, participate effectively.


To be completed
===============

* committee meetings
* how to ensure everyone is working effectively
* delegating versus doing it yourself
* getting people to do things
* dealing with problems
