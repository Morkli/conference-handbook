Community conference organisers's handbook
=================================================================

The main purpose of this document is to help you avoid being remembered as *that idiot who
tried to organise a conference*.

How to use the handbook
=======================

The Handbook is organised around the :ref:`timeline` - the milestone items that you will need to do
in the run-up to the event. It also discusses some of the practicalities that you need to have set
up or in place to plan and execute the event successfully - most of these are also linked to from
the timeline, as well as being listed separately in the contents.

About the handbook
==================

The handbook was created by Daniele Procida, Community and Documentation Manager at `Divio AG
<http://divio.ch>`_ of ZÃ¼rich. It's based on the experiences of organising and attending numerous
international Python/Django events.

It's aimed particularly at organisers of Python/Django community events, and reflects the
traditions and values of PyCons and DjangoCons.
