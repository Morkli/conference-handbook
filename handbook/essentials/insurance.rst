Insurance

.. important::

   You might not like the idea of buying insurance against something you expect not to happen, but
   you also won't like spending months organising an event and then finding at the last minute that
   an ash cloud, industrial action by air-traffic controllers or other intervention of fate strikes
   a mortal blow against all your carefully-laid plans, or that an accident at the event

   This is why you have insurance: to protect you from the possibly huge financial losses that you
   could face.

Insurance won't protect you against circumstances that are wholly beyond your control. The right
circumstances will ruin your event. But, proper insurance cover will at least mean that you and
other people don't suffer financially as a result.

Imagine the worst-case scenario: that everyone has turned up in your city ready for your
conference, and for whatever reason, there is no conference. Perhaps the venue has burned down
overnight. Perhaps everyone on the committee has fallen too ill to work. Perhaps there's an armed
siege taking place on that side of town.

It doesn't have to be anything dramatic: a broken sewer pipe can do the job just as well as
devasting conflagration.

If you're obliged to give attendees or sponsors their money back (and some will have paid by credit
card, so even if *you* don't feel obliged, some will get their money back whether you like it or
not) you could easily find yourself facing bills substantially larger than your annual income - a
ruinous sum.

If you're not able to pay everyone back, you could even face legal action by your creditors.

If you're ever able to show your face in the community again after such a debacle, you really will
be remembered as *that idiot who tried to organise a conference*.

This is what insurance will protect you against.

An example
==========

There are various kinds of insurance for events, and numerous companies that specialise in
providing events insurance.

For `DjangoCon Europe 2015 <http://2015.djangocon.eu>`_ Europe 2015, our insurance included cover
against:

* Cancellation/abandoment of the event: £117'000

  Covered expenses in the event of having to return money for a cancelled event, claims against us
  in case we failed to vacate the venue in time, and so on. We were protected against bad weather
  and terrorists, but specifically not against the activity of Icelandic volcanos.

  Our expenses were covered, but *not* loss of net profit (which would make it qute a bit more
  expensive), since we weren't relying on making any.

* Property damage at the venue: £30'000

  Covered our property and other people's property, including while being transported. Items such
  as laptop computers were excluded.

* Public liability: £2'000'000

  General damage or harm for which we could be held liable. £2'000'000 would represent an extremely
  memorable software conference, though sadly criminal defence and pollution cover were limited to
  a mere £100'000 each.

* Employer's liability: £10'000'000

  Obviously we had no employees, but even unpaid volunteers count as employees.

This cover for six days at our two venues, provided by `Hiscox Events Insurance
<http://www.hiscox.co.uk/events/>`_ cost us just under £620 and took half an hour to arrange. It
was a small price to pay for the peace of mind. We never did have to find out whether we were
covered against boy bands.
