Committee phone numbers
=======================

*Please don’t hesitate to ask a member of the committee for advice, help or information.*

[list the phone numbers of committee members]

Code of Conduct
===============

You need to be familiar with the code of conduct (see website or programme booklet). The short
version is: no-one at the event is to suffer harrassment or abuse of any form, and no-one should
behave in a way that distresses anyone else.

If you become aware of any problem, speak to any member of the committee immediately.

Please don’t attempt to resolve, investigate, or otherwise deal with the problem beyond
establishing basic facts like the names of people concerned.

Co-ordinator
============

[checklists for co-ordinators]

At the start of each day
------------------------

* note which sessions you are chairing
* where and when they are


Before each session
-------------------

* make sure your runner is ready
* introduce yourself to each of the speakers
* make sure they know where and when they have to be
* ensure you can pronounce their names correctly
* note down how they’d like to be introduced, and whether there’s something you should mention
* remind your speakers to have water in their bottles

Before each talk
----------------

* remind the speaker how long they have:
  * open day talks and short talks: 20 minutes including questions
  * longer talks: 45 minutes including questions

* ask the speaker how long they intend to speak
* note down the speaker’s ending time at the start of the talk

During each talk
----------------

* keep an eye on the time
* use the “20/15/10/5 minutes remaining” cards to indicate remaining speaking time
* prepare and write down at least three different questions for the speaker
* maintain eye contact with the speaker and look as though you’re enjoying the talk, especially if
  the speaker seems nervous; a discreet thumbs-up, OK sign or nodding in agreement always helps

After each talk
---------------

* thank the speaker
* start the questions (see below)
* invite further questions
* keep an eye on the time, and announce “two more short questions please”
* thank the speaker again
* help the speaker down from the stage and make sure they have all their things

Notes
-----

A speaker must **never** be allowed to deliver a talk and not have questions from the audience. You
are responsible for starting the questions, so that other members of the audience have time to
gather their thoughts for their own questions. Preparing some in advance makes this a lot easier.

It doesn’t matter if a speaker ends sooner than expected, but a speaker who goes over time will be
a problem.

Emergency questions
-------------------

If you find yourself - you shouldn’t - in a situation of having to start the questions and don’t have any ready:

* “What do you think is the single most valuable lesson to be drawn from your experience?”
* “Can you say little bit more about how you/why you did/chose/suffered from such-and-such?”
* “Where do you think this will take you/you will take this next?”
* “Can you explain [some deeply technical thing that was mentioned] in a little more detail?”

Runner
======

As well as being a runner, you’re also a backup Co-ordinator - so please be aware of what the Co-ordinator needs to do, just in case there’s a problem.

At the start of each day
------------------------

* note which sessions you are responsible for
* where and when they are

Before each session
-------------------

make sure your Co-ordinator knows you’re there


Time cards
==========

[At the back of the handbook it's a good idea to have some pages with large text showing remaining
time, that can be shown to the speakers, for 20/15/10/5/0 minutes.]
