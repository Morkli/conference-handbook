Community conference organisers's handbook
=================================================================

.. note::

    The main purpose of this document is to help you avoid being remembered as *that idiot who
    tried to organise a conference*.

How to use the handbook
=======================

The Handbook is organised around the :ref:`timeline` - the milestone items that you will need to do
in the run-up to the event. It also discusses some of the practicalities that you need to have set
up or in place to plan and execute the event successfully - most of these are also linked to from
the timeline.

Start by reading the :ref:`timeline`.

About the handbook
==================

The handbook was created by Daniele Procida, Community and Documentation Manager at `Divio AG
<http://divio.ch>`_ of ZÃ¼rich. It's based on the experiences of organising and attending numerous
international Python/Django events.

It's aimed particularly at organisers of Python/Django community events, and reflects the
traditions and values of PyCons and DjangoCons.

.. note::

   This is a handbook, not an instruction manual. Every conference is different enough that you
   some of the advice here might not be applicable, or you simply might have your own preferences
   and ways of doing things.


.. note::

   This handbook is currently incomplete and numerous sections still need to be written.
