Committee
=========


.. warning::

   **You can't do this alone. It will be damaging for you, and extremely risky for the event.**

   You need to find ways to build collaboration into the working process early on. If you're not
   good at that - for example if your natural inclination is to find it easier to do everything
   yourself - you need to start learning how to do it.


Committee roles
===============

Why defined roles are important
-------------------------------

You should establish clear roles and responsibilities as soon as possible.

These roles aren't just unnecessary structure, they are needed because they help people get
involved and work with you and each other; they tell people what they are getting into and what
needs to be done.

If people don't know what is expected of them and what they are supposed to be doing, they often
won't do it. This mostly isn't because they are lazy or lack initiative, or even because they
didn't know they were supposed to be doing it, but because it wasn't clear it was all right for
them to do it.

Having named, defined roles allows people to understand the scale and scope of the various tasks that need to be undertaken, and allows them to have confidence to act and do things.

It also helps you see who is able to undertake these roles - if someone has a clear role with
responsibilities and isn't dealing with them, that will be come quickly obvious. If they only have
vague or undefined responsibilities, you'll have no idea what they are capable of.

**The sooner you can do this the better.** Later on you will need someone to drop everything to
visit a venue at 9am, or to run a Python script on a list of attendees late at night, and you can't
afford to find out only when you need their help that they are unable or unwilling.

Suggested roles
---------------

Your committe should have a formal:

* Chair - the person leading the event
* Treasurer - to handle money: banking, invoicing, payments
* Secretary - to maintain an official record of meetings, and note who has agreed to do what

There are also other roles that need to be allocated; one person can take on more than one of these, and people can be jointly responsible:

* :doc:`/communications/index` - publicity, news
* Designer - print and web, posters, banners, t-shirts, badges
* Webmaster - web content and updates
* :doc:`/tickets` - responsible for tickets, refunds, allocations
* :doc:`/sponsorship`


Fostering collaboration
=======================

Your team needs to be that: a team.

It doesn't matter how energetic or experienced each person on the team is, your most important job
as the leader of the team is to find a way to ensure that they can all, and will all, participate
effectively.

Your responsibility
-------------------

If you aren't able to do that, it's **your fault, not theirs**. They signed up to help as
volunteers, and people rarely do that if they don't intend to volunteer.

The more this project has been your own personal project, the more you need to be aware of that,
and the harder you will have to work to make it become a genuine team.

Make room for people
--------------------

Some people are confident and will happily march in and start doing things. Most people are not
that at-ease when it comes to someone else's project, however willing and helpful they are, so
you need to make it easier for them.

Having defined roles (above) helps make room for other people to come in, but you can also step
back from particular tasks and responsibilities altogether. These need to be substantial ones, so
that whoever takes them on feels they have a free hand. In fact you will typically find that they
choose to work with others, and also want you involved, but the point is that by stepping away you
will have made room for them to take it on.

**This will only work if you do it from the start.** Later on, it will be too late.

Delegation
----------

People say "delegation is hard!", and it's true, but also a bit more complex than that.

Delegating *tasks* is actually fairly easy, especially if you have willing helpers. You need more
than that though, unless you really think you can spend the entire planning process asking people
to do particular things.

More difficult, and more effective, is to delegate *responsibilities*, letting people work out what
their own tasks in a certain area are, priorities for them, and so on. You need a great deal of
common understanding for this to work: if you delegate responsibility for managing volunteers to
someone, and it turns out that they didn't realise this included responsibility for recruiting
them, you're going to find yourselves in an awkward position.

The higher the level of delegation, the better communication must be in order for it to work.

However, it's easier to start with *more delegation rather than less*, and *sooner rather than
later*.

People can always give back the parts of their responsibilities that they don't won't relatively
easily, but taking on something that someone else has been working on, in their way and according
to their own ideas is more difficult.

You'll soon find if a delegated responsibility isn't something one of your team is able or willing
to deal with, and if you do this early in the planning process, it won't matter very much. If you
discover it later on, it could be more of a problem.

.. important:: **Everything you don't delegate will be something you have to do yourself.**

   If you think delegation's hard, try doing everything yourself. A conference organised by a
   heroic do-it-all might be a success, but is at great risk of being a disaster, and a bad
   experience for you.
