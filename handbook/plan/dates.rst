Dates
======

Check that your proposed dates are not likely to be adversely affected by significant events such
as:

* public or religious holidays
* elections
* major sporting eventing or cultural events

It can be harder than you think to find a suitable window, especially for a larger event
in a smaller city.

Don't forget that your attendees may need a day either side of the event if they are travelling
long distances.
