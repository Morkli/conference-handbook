Programme booklet
=================


Your programme booklet can be anything from a single sheet of paper with some minimal information
to a 40-page volume. In fact, you don't even *need* to have one at all, but it is a nice thing to
have - useful at the time, a souvenir that people can keep and a record for future events.

How long it is and what gets put in it depends on what you consider its purpose to be, but at any
rate, a programme booklet that doesn't give attendees an easy way to find out what's happening when
is not worth the effort - so make that a priority.


Contents
========

Put key information, that people will need to refer to often, towards the front and the back of the
booklet.

The two middle pages - if the programme booklet is saddle-stitched, which is most likely the case -
are also a good place to put key information, because the booklet will natually fall open at these
pages.

Contents can include:

* a description of talks and speakers
* maps
* code of conduct
* sponsor advertisements
* an at-a-glance listing of sessions - this is best placed in a double-page spread across the final
  page and inside back cover, or across the two middle pages
* contact information
* thank-yous


Printing
========

If you're not already familiar with your printer's requirements, or indeed with print industry
standards, *find out exactly what you need to supply well in advance*, and don't assume you know
what it is until you do.

For example...

CMYK
----

Likely most of the images you supply and work with are in RGB colourspace; printers work with CMYK.

RGB images will be a little duller and darker when printed, and there may be some some strange
anomalies. Things that might appear identical on screen can look remarkably different in print.


Bleed
-----

Usually printers will want to be provided with files that incorporate a bleed width of around 3mm.
The simplest way to do this if you're not using professional-level software for preparing your
materials is to use custom page or canvas sizes that incorporate the extra bleed width.


Number of pages
---------------

A printed booklet must have a number of pages divisible by four, including its inner and outer
covers.


Send a draft version to test the process
----------------------------------------

You don't want to be dealing with unexpected glitches when you have a print deadline, so send your
printers a draft version of the programme booklet two months before the event starts. You'll soon
find out whether there are any problems looming, and you'll also discover how helpful and friendly
the printers and willing to spend time solving your problems - an equally important thing to know.


Proof-reading
=============

Any mistakes you make will be in print forever. Just saying.
