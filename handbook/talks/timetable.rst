===================
The day's timetable
===================

Selecting and sequencing a :doc:`/talks/programme-of-talks` might be an art, but timetabling them
is probably a science.

You can spend *hours* trying to put together a timetable that works well, that leaves sensible and
adequate room for breaks and lunches and changeovers, and that adds up to a good day of talks.


Some timetabling rules of thumb
===============================

* it simplifies things if every session can start on on the hour or half-hour.

* the maximum time between breaks should be two hours - it's too much to ask your attendees and
  their coffee-filled bladders to last longer than that at a time

* more than one long talk (40-60 minutes including questions) without a break in between is
  excessive

* don't make a long talk the last one before lunch or a break

* try to avoid asking your attendees to sit through more than seven hours' worth of talks a day

* hold lightning talks early on in the programme, so that people who experience them for the first
  time get the opportunity to think: *I could do that*

* build some slack into the programme to allow for the unexpected, and to recover from it

* give yourself small buffers:
  * around the start and first talk
  * before and after breaks

  They will fill themselves up naturally, and if they don't, nobody will be inconvenienced

* the slot before lunch should be lively and fast-moving, otherwise attendees' thoughts start to
  drift towards their next meal

* the session after lunch needs to be light, fast, short and preferably amusing, because many
  people will be experiencing a post-prandial slump - it's a bad idea to put a long and difficult
  technical talk in this slot

* a good way of dividing up the day is:
  * a first morning session
  * a break
  * a second morning session
  * lunch
  * a first afternoon session
  * a break
  * a second afternoon session



Example plans
=============

These are all based on actual examples that worked well. They also all include margins to absorb
delays - there are always delays - and leave you some room for ad-hoc announcements.

Always make sure you include time for introductions, both at the start of the day and for speakers
when they come on stage, and for closing remarks and thank-yous. Don't underestimate how long it
takes to get through a round of thank-yous, especially at a larger event with an enthusiastic
community audience.

Plan one: 25-minute slots
-------------------------

Suitable for a single-day event.

This works well because every session will start on on the hour or half-hour.

Everyone gets a slot the same length, 25 minutes each including questions, in blocks of two hours
at a time, with a slightly longer keynote at the start.

Breaks and lunches are multiples of 30 minutes.

You *can* create a 60-minute slot this way, but that's a very long talk. If you want to have a talk
that's longer than 30 minutes, it's better to make it about 45 minutes and use the remaining time
for announcements, welcome addresses and so on, as in the example of the opening keynote talk.

Start times are prices.

18.00 Close

Plan two: 20-minute slots
-------------------------

Suitable for an open day, where you need a fast-paced programme for a general audience of possibly
unknown interests and expertise, including some who may be school pupils.

Leaves plenty of room to insert announcements, or to absorb overruns.

Start times are *nominal*; even if it seems that some slots are longer than others,
that's simply because it makes the start times more convenient to deal with. The point is that
within each block there is sufficient time for the talks and an allowance for changeovers,
small announcements and so on.

Plan three: long and short talks
--------------------------------

Talks are in two-hour or 90-minute blocks, mixing up long (40 minutes including questions) and
short talks (20 minutes including questions).

This scheme is more suited to a longer conference.

Start times are nominal.

Breaks

Lunches
-------

Different cultures have different expectations for lunch. Your French or Italian attendees might be
a vaguely appalled to when confronted by a lunch hour that's only 60 minutes long, while a north
American or northern European might consider lunch at 13.00 to be on the late side. Adjust your
timetable accordingly.
