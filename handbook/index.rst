   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

=================================================================
Handbook for open-source software community conference organisers
=================================================================

.. note::

    The main purpose of this document is to help you avoid being remembered as "that idiot who
    tried to organise a DjangoCon".

It's based on the experiences of organising four international events (`Django Weekend Cardiff 2014
<http://djangoweekend.org>`_, `DjangoCon Europe 2014 <http://2014.djangocon.eu>`_, `Python Namibia
2015 <http://python-namibia.org>`_ and `DjangoCon Europe 2015 <http://2015.djangocon.eu>`_) as well
as attending many more.

It's also aimed particularly at organisers of Python/Django community events, and reflects the
traditions and values of PyCons and DjangoCons.

*Please note that this handbook is currently incomplete and numerous sections still need to be
written.*

How to use the handbook
=======================

Firstly, be aware that this is a handbook, not an instruction manual. Every conference is different
enough that you some of the advice here might not be applicable, or you simply might have your own
preferences and ways of doing things.

The timeline
------------

The :doc:`timeline </timeline>` is probably the best place to start, and something you'll want to
refer to throughout the organising process. Very likely you will need to adapt to your own needs.
For example if you have decided to hold an event in six months' time, you'll need to compress the
timeline substantially.

A timeline like this gives you a clear synoptic and *visual* indication of your progress.

You **need to make your own timeline** - it needs to have *actual* dates in it, and it needs to be
shared with all the other organisers.

Any item that can't be checked off needs to be moved forward to the next day or week.
