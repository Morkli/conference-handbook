Where in the world will your conference be?
-------------------------------------------

A city with good transport connections to the rest of the world is a safe choice, but your choice
doesn't have to be limited to cities.

With the right planning, an event in a holiday resort or the countryside can work equally well
(`several editions of PyCon Poland have done this <https://pl.pycon.org/2017/place_en.html>`_).


Questions to ask
----------------

Wherever it is, ask yourself some questions:

* Does cost of living there mean the conference is generally affordable?
* How will people travel there?
* How affordable will travel be?
* Is there suitable :ref:`accommodation` available locally?
* Is it a safe, friendly place for visitors?
