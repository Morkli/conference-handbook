   contain the root `toctree` directive.

=================================================================
Handbook for open-source software community conference organisers
=================================================================

.. note::

    The main purpose of this document is to help you avoid being remembered as *that idiot who
    tried to organise a DjangoCon*.

The handbook was created by Daniele Procida, Community and Documentation Manager at `Divio AG
<http://divio.ch>`_ of ZÃ¼rich. It's based on the experiences of organising four international
events:

* `Django Weekend Cardiff 2014 <http://djangoweekend.org>`_
* `DjangoCon Europe 2014 <http://2014.djangocon.eu>`_
* `Python Namibia 2015 <http://python-namibia.org>`_
* `DjangoCon Europe 2015 <http://2015.djangocon.eu>`_

as well as attending many more.

It's also aimed particularly at organisers of Python/Django community events, and reflects the
traditions and values of PyCons and DjangoCons.

*Please note that this handbook is currently incomplete and numerous sections still need to be
written.*


How to use the handbook
=======================

Firstly, be aware that this is a handbook, not an instruction manual. Every conference is different
enough that you some of the advice here might not be applicable, or you simply might have your own
preferences and ways of doing things.

.. note:: The timeline

   The :doc:`timeline </timeline>` is probably the best place to start, and something you'll want
   to refer to throughout the organising process.
