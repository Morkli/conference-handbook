Plan your event
======================================


Various things will determine the fundamental shape and character of your event, including its
scale, duration and ethos.

You need to have a very strong idea of all of these from the start - they are what your conference
will be, and they need to be commnicated clearly otherwise potential attendees and sponsors won't
understand what it is that they're being asked to commit to.

What is the focus of your event? What is it actually about? Why are you holding it and what do you
want attendees to get out of it?

An established event will largely have these questions settled, by remit and tradition. If you're
organising a DjangoCon, you'll know what's expected for example. If you're holding a new event,
you'll need to make some decisions.
